Day 1 - Learned how to query active network connections by using the command: ifconfig. Basic knowledge about 
network interfaace card (NIC), media access control (MAC) (Hwaddr), and internet protocol (IP). For IP, researched about Bcast or
broadcast address which sends information to all IP address on the subnet (haven't learned it yet). Netmask or network mask, 
which determines what part of the IP add is connected to the local network. Show Network Statistics with netstat (old way to show network statistics)
or use ss command for the modern and more readable format. Can use options like (-u -t -l -a). Use -u for UDP connections which means
User Datagram Protocol, -t for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections, -l for listening connections, -a for showing all sockets. 
Used the command: iwconfig, to check wireless network devices. Assigned or SPOOF a new IP Address using sudo ifconfig <network> <newip>
for MAC Address, sudo ifconfig eth0 down, sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether <add>, sudo ifconfig eth0 up. Assigning new IP address from DHCP server using
sudo dhclient eth0 (had problems running this command). Manipulate DNS using dig <dns-server> <type> which I learned to use mx - mailserver, ns - nameserver
change DNS server using the command mousepad. sudo mousepad /etc/resolv.conf, can do overwriting with echo command. Mapping your own IP addr
with mousepad again using: sudo mousepad /etc/hosts. -EOD
